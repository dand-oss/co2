# CO2-Carbon-Dioxide-Property-Calculation

# 1. Background

The thermophysical properties of CO2 are very important to researchers and engineers in various domains (energy, power, chemistry, materials ...).

Usually, researchers and engineers rely on the [NIST Refprop](https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop) to calculate the properties. However, Refprop is commercial and not open-source. Therefore, I wrote this code to provide an alternative to the refprop.

# 2. Brief Intro

Program Name: High-resolution CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) Properties Calculation

Purpose: Calculate the **very-high-resolution** thermophysical properties at given point(s)

# 3. How-To: Build, Run, and Use

## 3.1 Build

### 3.1.1 Prerequisites

You need a C compiler to build. 

- For Microsoft Windows users, [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) is a good choice
- For GNU/Linux Distro or other *nix users, the [GNU Compiler Collections](https://gcc.gnu.org/), known as gcc, is a perfect one
- For macOS users, [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) is easy to install and use (brew is not needed to install clang on macOS).

### 3.2 Build Guide

1. Use git to clone this code: `git clone https://github.com/zhenrong-wang/co2.git`
2. Build command example: `gcc co2-prop.c -o my-co2.exe -lm`

## 3.2 Run

- Copy the executable to a working directory. and open a terminal/command prompt
- Create an input file named '**_input.dat**' with some input data (See Section 3.3 below)
- Run the executable in the terminal or command prompt by the command `./my-co2.exe` (for *nix users) or `.\my-co2.exe` (for Microsoft Windows users)

## 3.3 Use

For the **_input.dat** file, you need to input the data in lines. A single line refers to a point. Strict format:

`POINT_TYPE(int),PARAM1(float/double),PARAM2 (float/double)` 

**Please separate the params by a comma ','

POINT_TYPE: 

- 1 Pressure and Temperature
- 2 Pressure and Specific Enthalpy
- 3 Pressure and Specific Entropy
- 4 Specific Enthalpy and Specific Entropy
- 5 Temperature and Density
- 6 Pressure and Density
- 7 Temperature and Specific Enthalpy
- 8 Temperature and Specific Entropy

Example: `1,100000,300`

Example: `1,1e5,3e2`

Units:

- Pressure: Pa
- Temperature: K
- Density: kg/m3
- Specific Enthalpy: J/kg
- Specific Entropy: J/(kg.K)

## 3.4 Output

The program writes out a file named '**_properties.dat**' in the working directory. Here are some extra properties:

- Vsound: Velocity of sound
- V_FRAC: The mass ratio of gas when the point is in dual-phase
- VISC: Viscosity
- THCOND: Thermal Conductivity ratio

# 4 Bugs and Communications

This code was written years ago, I didn't continuously develop it. Therefore, bugs may occur. 

If you are interested in this project, please submit issues to this repo. I'd be glad to communicate on any issues.
